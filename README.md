# TripTales
A Travel Blog with Kids in Mind!

  I was once a young chap being carted around by my folks on roadtrips, field trips, trips of all sorts.  I wanted to make an app for young people to record their experiences and record their ideas.

  Technologies used:

  -Express
  -Node.js
  -Passport/Bcrypt
  -Google Maps API
  -Mulder (for user file uploads)
